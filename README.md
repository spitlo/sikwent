# /'siːkwənt/

/'siːkwənt/ is an experiment in sequencing. The idea is that every new track that is added have one more "tick" than the one before. Ticks are sixteenth notes.

You start with a single track with a single tick (checkbox). To add a track, you must first activate a tick in the current one. As soon as you do, a new track becomes available. Deactivating every tick in a higher track won’t delete the channels below.

You can mute individual tracks by using keys `a` to `z` on your keyboard. Or by clicking/tapping the track name.

/'siːkwənt/ is some sort of sibling to [Space](https://spitlo.com/space/) and also uses [Tone.js](https://tonejs.github.io/), but for this I used [Solid](https://docs.solidjs.com/) instead of vanilla JavaScript

## To do

- [ ] Delay synth initialization?
- [ ] Kill all notes on stop
- [x] Add one more engine
- [x] Add two sampler channels
- [x] Everything
- [x] FIX LAG!
- [x] Fix saving/loading
- [x] Styling
- [x] Tweak all synths
- [x] What if the first checkbox is huge? And centered? Then when track two appears, checkboxes get smaller... and smaller.
- [x] ~~Learn Tailwind~~ or throw it out!
- [x] ~~Shift + [a-z] "fills" channel? Or inverts pattern?~~
- [x] ~~Shift clicking fills that column, alt clicking fills row?~~
- [x] ~~Start using Kobalte?~~
