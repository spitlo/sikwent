# /'siːkwənt/

/'siːkwənt/ is an experiment in sequencing. The idea is that every new track that is added have one more "tick" than the one before. Ticks are sixteenth notes.

You start with a single track with a single tick (checkbox). To add a track, you must first activate a tick in the current one. As soon as you do, a new track becomes available. Deactivating every tick in a higher track won’t delete the channels below. (But it will/might/should? mute them until the higher track is active again. This could be used for creative muting.)

/'siːkwənt/ is some sort of sibling to [Space](https://spitlo.com/space/) and also uses [Tone.js](https://tonejs.github.io/), but for this I used [Solid](https://docs.solidjs.com/) instead af vanilla JavaScript
