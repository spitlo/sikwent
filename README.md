# /'siːkwənt/

/'siːkwənt/ is an experiment in looping. The idea is that every new channel that is added have one more "tick" than the one before. Ticks are sixteenth notes.

You start with a single channel with a single tick (checkbox). To add a channel, you must first activate a tick in the current one. As soon as you do, a new channel becomes available. Deactivating every tick in a higher channel won’t delete the channels below, but it will/might/should? mute them until the higher channel is active again. This can be used for creative muting.
